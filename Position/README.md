# CSS Position

- **Static:** It is the default position shows how the HTML document works
    - HTML
        - Head
        - Body
        - Footer
- **Relative:** Act like Static, but allow to change the top, left, right, bottom, based on itself. The change can overflow and affects other elements. This will allow the child element to act relatively.
- **Absolute:** Document will ignore the element with position absolute, other elements will be generated as there is no this element exists. It moves based on the parent.
- **Fixed:** fixed position of the element and stay there, no matter the page has been scrolled.
- **Sticky:** Relative + Fix, by default it acts like relative, when the page is moved, scrolled, the element will be stuck at the top as fixed.
